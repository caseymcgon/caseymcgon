## ðŸŒŽ I like data and I like this green Earth

###### - ðŸ”‹ I'm currently working as a Battery Data Scientist at Liminal Insights where I focus on building tools to monitor the consistency & quality of the data produced by our systems & detect unexpected changes to our systems. 
###### - ðŸ”­ I've done this outside of work: 1. Developing a state-of-the-art NLP model to predict a song's era from its lyrics 2. Creating an experiment to understand [how leaderboards impact one's risk tolerance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBxlMlpD1-fswTaecmRI94XVzROEGnFanJJ8W5-6COU/edit?usp=sharing)
###### - ðŸŽ“ I studied Deep Learning w/ Natural Language Processing & Causal Inference via Experimentation for my Masters Degree at UC Berkeley
###### - ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™d love to chat about which climate x data problems I should tackle next
###### - ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email: cmcgon@ischool.berkeley.edu or Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/casey-mcgonigle
