## I'm a Data Science Grad Student at UC Berkeley with a passion for fighting climate change, exploring the outdoors, cheering for Bay Area sports, and enjoying live music.

###### - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data science projects like: 1. Developing a state-of-the-art NLP model to predict a song's era from its lyrics 2. Creating an experiment to understand [how leaderboards impact one's risk tolerance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBxlMlpD1-fswTaecmRI94XVzROEGnFanJJ8W5-6COU/edit?usp=sharing)

###### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying Deep Learning w/ Natural Language Processing & Experiments and Causal Inference at the Graduate level
###### - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on climate change x data science projects.
###### - ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ideation about which climate x data problems I should tackle next
###### - ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email: cmcgon@ischool.berkeley.edu or Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/casey-mcgonigle
###### - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the best spots to camp/backpack around the Bay Area
###### - ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
###### - ðŸŽ¸ Fun fact: I'm a live music junkie -- everything from music in the local park to underground jazz clubs to stadium rock shows. I'm currently at around  200 live shows in my life...and I'm just gettin started!


## My Github currently contains 5 pinned projects/repos:

1. **caseymcgon/climate-enviro-energy**: Mar 2022 - Present -- An effort to combine hundreds of climate-centric data sources into 1 repo to encourage more research & modeling to combat climate change 

2. **caseymcgon/power-forward**: Jan 2021 - May 2021 -- Focused on understanding why Electric Vehicle Charging Stations succeed or fail and ultimately mapping how well potential new stations will perform. Selection of Skills & Tools: python, sklearn models, Selenium webscraping, ArcGis, Flask

3. **caseymcgon/NFLPlayoffFantasyFootball**: Jan 2020 - Present (updated each January) -- Webscraping, Regex, and Pandas skills mobilized to efficiently compile and manipulate NFL Playoff scoring data for family and friends' Playoff Fantasy Football Pool.

4. **caseymcgon/EBCE-Disconnections-Research**: Jan 2020 - May 2020 -- Executive Summary of a Semester-long Research Project for East Bay Community Energy (EBCE) -- Building ML models to discern which buildings are likely to disconnect from the electrical grid. Selection of Skills & Tools: python, sklearn, matplotlib. Please note: this repo contains no code as it is owned by EBCE.

5. **caseymcgon/Data100GradProject**: Apr 2020 - May 2020 -- Used python, pandas, & seaborn to understand what fantasy basketball scores actually measure, which factors tend to influence them, and how to best be predict them
