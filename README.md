## 🌎 I like data and I like this green Earth

###### - 🔋 I'm currently working as a Battery Data Scientist at Liminal Insights where I focus on building tools to detect changes to the consistency & quality our systems' data generation
###### - 🔭 I've done this outside of work: 1. Created a state-of-the-art NLP model to predict a song's era from its lyrics 2. Created an experiment to understand [how leaderboards impact one's risk tolerance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SBxlMlpD1-fswTaecmRI94XVzROEGnFanJJ8W5-6COU/edit?usp=sharing)
###### - 🎓 I studied: Deep Learning w/ Natural Language Processing & Causal Inference via Experimentation during my Masters Degree at UC Berkeley (MIDS).
###### - 👋 I’d love to chat about: which climate x data problems I should tackle next
###### - 📫 How to reach me: Email: cmcgon@ischool.berkeley.edu or Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/casey-mcgonigle
###### - 💬 Ask me about: the best spots to camp/backpack around the Bay Area, Fantasy Football, the best '73 dead shows.
###### - 👦 Pronouns: He/Him

   --> Selected Skills & Tools: python, streamlit, webscraping (bs4), Regex, and pandas, Google API
2. **caseymcgon/climate-enviro-energy**: (Mar 2022 - Present) -- Combined hundreds of climate-centric data sources into 1 repo to encourage data-centric understanding of & combat against climate change 

3. **caseymcgon/power-forward**: (Jan 2021 - May 2021) -- A capstone project focused on understanding why Electric Vehicle Charging Stations succeed or fail and ultimately mapping how well potential new stations will perform.

   --> Selected Skills & Tools: python, sklearn, Selenium webscraping, ArcGis, Flask

4. **caseymcgon/EBCE-Disconnections-Research**: (Jan 2020 - May 2020) -- The Executive Summary of a Semester-long Research Project for East Bay Community Energy (EBCE). We Built ML models to discern which buildings are likely to disconnect from the electrical grid.

    --> Selected Skills & Tools: python, sklearn, matplotlib. Please note: this public repo unfortunately contains no code as that is property of by EBCE.

5. **caseymcgon/Data100GradProject**: (Apr 2020 - May 2020) -- A research project investigating what fantasy basketball scores actually measure, which factors tend to influence them, and how to best predict them
